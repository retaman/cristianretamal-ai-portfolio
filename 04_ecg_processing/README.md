# ECG Signal Processing – MIT-BIH Dataset

This project demonstrates real-world signal analysis using ECG (Electrocardiogram) data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, hosted on PhysioNet.

The notebook includes:

- Loading ECG signals from a real patient (record 100)
- Visualizing the waveform over time
- Detecting heartbeats (R-peaks)
- Calculating Heart Rate (HR)
- Extracting RR intervals and computing Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- WFDB library
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

## Why this project matters

Heart signals are complex and non-linear. Processing and interpreting these biomedical signals requires signal processing knowledge and applied machine learning — both are highly relevant in health-tech, neuroscience, wearable devices, and sports science.

This notebook is the beginning of a broader series on physiological data applications.
