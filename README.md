# Cristian Retamal – AI/ML Portfolio

Welcome to my technical portfolio. This repository showcases a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and applied projects I've developed as part of my training in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis.

My goal is to demonstrate hands-on technical skills and my readiness to contribute to research or development teams, especially in areas involving real-world data such as biomedical signals, compliance automation, and deep learning models.
